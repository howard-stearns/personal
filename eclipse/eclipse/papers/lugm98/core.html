<a name="core"><h2>2: Core Technologies</h2></a>

The Eclipse strategy is to tightly integrate Lisp and C within a
single address space, that is, within a single running program.<a
href="references.html#f1"><b>1</b></a> This integration involves more
than simply implementing Lisp within C. It requires Lisp programs and
utilities to behave compatibly with other C programs and utilities. In
order to accomplish all this, Elwood has synthesized a number of
technologies for Eclipse:

<p>
1. A naming convention that reflects the differences between C and
Lisp identifiers.

<p>
2. A core of C utilities for representing, initializing, and using
run-time-typed data; closures over lexical functions; multiple values;
dynamic binding; non-local exits; and cleanups.

<p>
3. Conservative garbage collection.

<p>
4. A run-time function-based interface to such Lisp utilities as the
object system and environment initialization.

<p>
Few C programmers need go into the details of these; it is enough to
know that they exist. The descriptions in this section do, however,
give experienced Lisp programmers some understanding of how Lisp
issues are handled in C by Eclipse. In all cases, each technology was
implemented for maximum portability and so that the design would seem
understandable and usable to both Lisp and C programmers.

<a name="identifiers"><h3>2.1: Identifiers</h3></a>

Eclipse defines a naming convention that maps Lisp names to C
identifiers. Eclipse uses this convention for each C identifier it
generates, including the entry points accessible in the Eclipse
library and identifiers appearing in translated user code. These
transformations apply only to C identifiers, all of which are
compile-time entities. Run-time data, such as the strings that form
<code>SYMBOL-NAME</code>s, are not transformed.

<p>
The transformation of identifiers is necessary because C imposes much
harsher restrictions on identifiers than Lisp.

<ul>
<p><li> Lisp separates functions, variables, types, blocks, and labels into
separate namespaces, while similarly named C objects conflict.

<p><li> Lisp has a package system to modularize namespaces.

<p><li> The scoping rules for names are different.

<p><li> C has several globally reserved words.

<p><li> C identifiers use a smaller character set, and do not allow
identifiers to begin with numbers.
</ul>

<p>
Eclipse addresses these differences by translating Lisp symbol names
to C identifiers using a convention that follows standard C practice.

<ul>
<p><li> Normal function names do not have underscores, but capitalize the
first letter of each word. A short package prefix is used. For
example, <code>CL:LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS</code> =>
<code>clLogicalPathnameTranslations()</code>, <code>USER::FOO-BAR</code> => <code>usrFooBar()</code>.

<p><li> The names of ``constant'' variables holding Lisp symbols are in upper
case with words separated by underscores. A short package prefix is
used. For example, <code>clNIL</code>, <code>clCALL_ARGUMENTS_LIMIT</code>,
<code>clLOGICAL_PATHNAME_TRANSLATIONS</code>, <code>usrFOO_BAR</code>.

<p><li> Lexical variables are in lower case, and underscores are used. For
example, <code>foo_bar</code>.
</ul>

<p>
Eclipse uses package prefixes only when needed for scope or
distinction, or because the identifier would be illegal or reserved
without it. The shortest package nickname is used by default as the
prefix. The system defines the package prefix ``cl'' for all system
utilities and ``usr'' for utilities defined in the Lisp <code>COMMON-LISP-USER</code>
package.

<p>
Lexical scope issues in function names (i.e., nested <code>FLET</code>/<code>LABEL</code>) are
handled by preserving the nested chain of function names, separated by
underscores. For example, <code>usrOuterFunction_InnerFunction()</code>. Eclipse
preserves method specializers and qualifiers, and <code>SETF</code> function names,
in a similar manner.

<p>
The ``pipe'' escape characters (e.g., <code>#\|</code>) used by the Lisp printer when
a symbol has non-default case are also part of an Eclipse C identifier
name.

<p>

Finally, when characters appear in a Lisp symbol that cannot appear in
a C identifier, Eclipse replaces the characters with an alphabetic
name in a contrasting case. Eclipse defines names for all the
non-alphabetic members of the <code>BASE-CHAR</code> repertoire, but
uses hex codes for extended characters (i.e., Unicode). For example,
<code>*DEBUG-IO*</code> => <code>clstarDEBUG_IOstar</code>,
<code>user::|lower-CASE|</code> => <code>usrpipelowerpipe_CASE</code>,
<code>LIST*</code> => <code>clLISTstar</code>,
<code>clListSTAR()</code>.

<p>
Lisp names that are interned in the C package are exempt from this
``name mangling.'' This allows Lisp programs to reference C utilities
that do not follow these conventions.

<a name="representation"><h3>2.2: Representation</h3></a>

Eclipse provides a single C header file, ``eclipse.h,'' which defines
Lisp data representations. Any C code that uses the Eclipse library
must include this file. The following sections describe some of the
representations defined in ``eclipse.h.''

<a name="objects"><h4>2.2.1: Objects</h4></a>

The header file defines a C typedef called <code>clObject</code>,
which is used by Eclipse to represent each Lisp
datum. <code>clObject</code> is defined as a machine word that can be
treated as either a pointer or as immediate data.<a
href="references.html#f2"><b>2</b></a>

<p>
Most kinds of <code>clObject</code>s are implemented in Eclipse as pointers to a
heap allocated structure. The first component of this structure
contains type information, including a pointer to the class
metaobject. On some architectures, Eclipse saves space for some data
types by using the least significant bits of the pointer for typing
information. Eclipse also represents some data such as fixnums and
characters by storing them directly in the <code>clObject</code> word as immediate
data. Again, the least significant word bits are used for typing. In
these latter cases, Eclipse reaches the class metaobject through a
globally known array, indexed by the low <code>clObject</code> bits.

<p>
The header file defines a macro to access the class metaobject of all
the built-in <code>clObject</code>s, including structure and instance
objects. The header file and the Eclipse library define a number of
macros and functions for creating different kinds of
<code>clObject</code>s from corresponding C data, and for accessing
the internal C data from different kinds of <code>clObject</code>s.<a
href="references.html#f3"><b>3</b></a>

<p>
To aid in linting, and to shield code from changes in <code>clObject</code>
implementation, the header file defines an assignment macro,
<code>clSetq(place, value)</code>, which usually expands into <code>((place) = (value))</code>.

<a name="functions"><h4>2.2.2: Functions</h4></a>

Eclipse compiles each Lisp function to a corresponding C function. The
generated C function uses the C variable argument mechanism
(varargs/stdargs) to accept <code>clObject</code>s as arguments. The arguments are
exactly the same as they are in Lisp, except that an additional
argument, the ``symbol'' <code>clEOA</code>, is appended as an End-Of-Arguments
marker. It is used by the function during argument parsing. Eclipse
<code>COMPILE-FILE</code> automatically adds this <code>clEOA</code> marker to Lisp function
calls in generated code. This use of <code>clEOA</code> is less error prone in
hand-written/modified C code than insisting that an explicit argument
count be provided. Some Lisp implementations pass data on a special
Lisp data stack. Eclipse programs pass arguments as ordinary C data.

<p>
No extra arguments are needed in Eclipse to represent the Lisp
function's defining environment. C programmers can call any Lisp
function without needing to know if or how the function refers to an
enclosing environment. Eclipse handles this automatically as follows.

<p>
Eclipse represents Lisp functions at run-time as closure <code>clObject</code>s
that contain the code to be executed (i.e., a C function pointer) and
the ``closed-over'' environment. The closure environment is defined by
Eclipse as a vector of those variable <code>clBinding</code>s (addresses of
<code>clObject</code>s) that were defined in the function's enclosing lexical
environment and used within the inner function code. For many
functions, the environment is empty; that is, there are no lexical
variables used within the function that are defined outside of
it. When Eclipse creates a closure <code>clObject</code>, it fills the closure's
environment with any necessary bindings.

<p>
In general, Eclipse uses ordinary C variables to represent local Lisp
variables. Eclipse <code>COMPILE-FILE</code> uses the same variable name and scope
in the generated C code as was present in the original Lisp
source. Eclipse declares these variables as being of type
<code>clObject</code>. Eclipse uses the address of the C variable as the <code>clBinding</code>
of a closed-over Lisp variable with dynamic-extent. However, for a
closed-over Lisp variable with indefinite-extent, Eclipse generates
code that heap allocates a <code>clBinding</code>. <code>clBinding</code>s are shared by all
closures over them, but environments are not.

<p>
For each function defined in a non-empty environment, Eclipse
<code>COMPILE-FILE</code> generates two ``environment hooks'' that point to a
closure's environment. One hook is defined statically, outside the C
function and the other is a local variable within the C function
definition. The static environment hook is initialized by Eclipse when
the closure <code>clObject</code> is created. Generated code initializes the local
environment hook from the static hook immediately upon entering the
function on each call. All references to enclosing variables from
within the inner generated function use this local environment hook to
access the <code>clBinding</code>. Using a cached local variable allows for
reentrant calls to identical code that is closed over different
bindings.

<p>
For ``top-level'' functions that only create closures once, Eclipse
initializes the static hook once and it is never changed. For
arbitrary Lisp closure objects created at run time, it is necessary to
call such functions through their closure objects using
<code>FUNCALL</code> or <code>APPLY</code>.<a
href="references.html#f4"><b>4</b></a> <code>FUNCALL</code> and
<code>APPLY</code> set the environment hook if necessary before
calling the implementing C function. The address of the static
environment hook is stored by Eclipse in the closure
<code>clObject</code>.

<a name="values"><h4>2.2.3: Multiple Values</h4></a>

Eclipse defines each generated C function to return the ``primary'' Lisp
value as an <code>clObject</code> value. Eclipse also defines a globally known
pointer to a buffer of multiple <code>clObject</code> values. Some functions just
return the values returned by other functions (i.e., are tail
calls). However, if a function returns a single value (e.g., the value
of a variable), then a macro from ``eclipse.h'' must be used to indicate
in the multiple values buffer that only one value is returned. The
function <code>clValues()</code> can also be used to fill the multiple value buffer
with zero or more values. Receiving multiple values is accomplished by
using a macro from ``eclipse.h'' that introduces a new multiple values
buffer as a local (automatic, stack) C variable. The macro stores the
location of this new buffer in the globally known pointer.

<a name="dynamic"><h4>2.2.4: Dynamic Environment</h4></a>

Eclipse uses a Lisp-specific control stack to keep dynamic environment
information such as dynamic bindings, active cleanups, and exits such
as catchers and closed over blocks/labels. The elements of this stack
are pointers to data identifying the kind of information.

<ul>
<p><li> Shallow binding is used for dynamic variables. Eclipse binds special
variables by placing the symbol and its old value on the control
stack, and setting the <code>SYMBOL-VALUE</code> to a new value.

<p><li> Exits are implemented with <code>setjmp()<code></code>/longjmp()</code>. Eclipse initializes a
C jmp_buf and caches the state of the multiple values machinery.
</ul>

<p>
Eclipse defines macros in ``eclipse.h'' for using the control stack to
establish dynamic bindings, blocks, tagbodies, catchers, and
cleanups. The header file also defines macros for non-local transfers
such as <code>RETURN-FROM</code>, <code>GO</code>, and <code>THROW</code> that unwind the control stack as
necessary. Besides using the appropriate <code>longjmp()</code> machinery, these
transfers take care of unwinding dynamic bindings and executing
<code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code> cleanup forms.

<a name="c"><h4>2.2.5: C Implementations</h4></a>

<code>COMPILE-FILE</code> does not generate platform- or
compiler-specific code. Eclipse abstracts any platform or compiler
dependencies into conditionally defined macros within ``eclipse.h.''
These macros cover such issues as word size, variable argument
mechanism, and function prototypes. This allows the same Eclipse code
to be processed by ANSI/ISO C compilers [<a
href="references.html#Harbison">Harbison</a>], traditional classic/K&R
C compilers [<a href="references.html#Kernighan">Kernighan</a>], or
C++ compilers.

<a name="memory"><h3>2.3: Memory Management</h3></a>

Eclipse uses a conservative, non-relocating garbage collector,
publicly available from Xerox PARC.[<a
href="references.html#Boehm">Boehm</a>] In this case, ``conservative''
means that C data, including that held on the C stack or in registers,
are traced by the garbage collector. The system assumes that anything
that looks like it could be a pointer to data is live, and the data
there is not collected. This allows user-written and Eclipse-generated
C code to pass Lisp data around as ordinary C data without any need to
``register'' them by hand with the garbage collector. In addition, the
collector recognizes a pointer that appears to point to within a heap
allocated datum. This allows the collector to work with ``mangled
pointers'' such as those described in <a
href="core.html#objects">Section 2.2.1</a>.

<p>
Non-relocating garbage collectors do not move heap allocated data
during collection. This allows Eclipse to implement <code>clObject</code>s as
pointers to data, as opposed to ``indexes,'' ``handles,'' ``pointers to
pointers,'' or other more complex things.

<p>
The garbage collector uses incremental/generational collection when
supported by the operating system. This means that only a small amount
of work is done during each collection, which reduces delays.

<p>
The garbage collector used was written for use in arbitrary C/C++
programs, and was not modified for use in Eclipse. It can be used
directly by C programmers without using the rest of Eclipse.

<p>
The collector defines alternatives to the standard <code>malloc()</code>
utilities. An application that uses <code>malloc()</code> or <code>sbrk()</code> will not work
with Eclipse, but must instead be changed to use <code>GC_malloc()</code>. Care
must be taken when calling certain operating system utilities from C
code, because they sometimes use incompatible malloc-like utilities
internally.

<p>
If the provided garbage collector is undesirable for some reason, it
can be replaced with any user-provided, conservative, non-relocating
system with a malloc-like interface.

<a name="function"><h3>2.4: Function-Based Interface</h3></a>

The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and the semantics of file
loading are two examples of Lisp utilities that have no analog in
C. Eclipse defines functions so that these utilities may be used
within C programs.

<a name="mop"><h4>2.4.1: CLOS-MOP</h4></a>

Eclipse implements not just the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), but
its complete MetaObject Protocol (MOP).[<a
href="references.html#Kiczales">Kiczales</a>] The CLOS-MOP defines a
function-based interface for defining, instantiating, and accessing
classes, and for defining and using generic functions and methods. It
is through these MOP functions that eclipse allows object-oriented
Lisp to be accessed by C, which defines only function-like interfaces
to data.<a href="references.html#f5"><b>5</b></a>

<a name="initialization"><h4>2.4.2: Initialization</h4></a>

Unlike C, Lisp source files can contain not only function definitions,
but arbitrary data as compile-file literals, and arbitrary top-level
code that is not part of a function definition. When a program or user
loads a Lisp file into any Lisp implementation, the system creates the
literal data, initializes it, and executes the top level code. C
provides no similar mechanism.

<p>
Consider, for example, a file that contains the following function definition:

<pre>
   (DEFUN MY-FUNCTION (A B) 
     (LIST A B))
</pre>

<code>DEFUN</code> is a macro that essentially expands this function
definition into something like:

<pre>
   (SETF (SYMBOL-FUNCTION 'MY-FUNCTION)
     (LAMBDA (A B) 
	(LIST A B)))
</pre>

<p>
When this is loaded into any Lisp implementation, the system creates a
function object (a closure) that is stored in the <code>SYMBOL-FUNCTION</code> of
the symbol <code>MY-FUNCTION</code>.

<p>
In Eclipse, when <code>COMPILE-FILE</code> generates a C file, it
generates one C function for each Lisp function in the source. It also
generates one extra C function, taking no arguments and returning no
value. This ``initialization function'' executes the ``load-time''
code. Calling this function is semantically equivalent to loading the
corresponding Lisp file. For example, the Eclipse-generated
initialization function for a file containing the previously discussed
<code>DEFUN</code> will intern the symbol <code>MY-FUNCTION</code> and
initialize it with a closure <code>clObject</code>. (See <a
href="core.html#functions">Section 2.2.2</a>.)

<p>
Before an applications calls any ``Lisp functions,'' it must first call
all the initialization functions for each user-generated file, as well
as those for the Eclipse library. For example:

<pre>
   /* Initialize Eclipse system code. */
   clInit();       /* Initialize Eclipse run-time library. */
   /* The next line is not needed in most applications. */
   clInitD();      /* Initialize Eclipse development library. */
   /* Initialize user code. */
   usrMyFile();    /* An Eclipse-generated initialization function 
		      for "my-file.lisp" */
   /* Now Lisp can be used. */
   clPrint(clEval(clRead(clEOA), clEOA), clEOA); ...
</pre>

<p>
Execution of the Eclipse-generated initialization function ensures that:

<ul>
<p><li> Symbols are interned.

<p><li> Other compile-time and load-time data are created and initialized,
including function closures for top-level functions.

<p><li> The closures of top-level functions are stored in the symbols.

<p><li> Any necessary environment hooks for these closures are initialized.
The top-level Eclipse read-eval-print loop program is essentially a
call to <code>clInit()</code> and <code>clInitD()</code>, followed by a call to the
read-eval-print loop.
