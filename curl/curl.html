<a href="http://curl.com">Curl&#8482;</a> is the original unified RIA
architecture. Starting in an MIT laboratory, by the year 2000 it
embodied such HTML5+CSS+Javascript+WebGL features as style sheets, 2D
and 3D graphics, drag and drop GUI, a Document Object Model, offline
storage, secure file access, and inter-app/inter-doc networking.

Curl's eyes only-<BR>
<I>A magazine article introducing Curl technology to developers,
suitable for such publications as "Dr. Dobbs Journal."
<P>
It is based on the premise that simply describing the features of the
Curl language invites unwanted comparison with other languages, and
allows people to think of us as "Yet Another Language."
<P>
Instead, a survey of the "gentle slope" is presented, based on the
"Curl in 10 Minutes" overview for developers.  Unlike the 10 minute
overview, this article explains more about the implications for
developers, end users and site owners.  The
traditional language-feature tour is relegated to a side-bar.</B>

The combination of Curl&#8482; technologies -- language, libraries, and
   implementation -- is designed for the practical distribution of
   full-featured applications over the Web.  These execute with the
   interactive feel of a native application rather than a static Web page.
   This article provides an introductory overview of the these
   technologies. It uses source code and graphics to illustrate the
   progression from: 
<UL>
   <LI>static content with client-side formatting, 
   <LI>through more interactive "live" pages and generative graphics,
   <LI>to more complex object-oriented applications.
</UL>

   The integration of these in a unified framework makes for richer
   applications that are easier to deploy and cheaper to operate
   relative to more specialized technologies.

   A side-bar uses code fragments to illustrates features of the
language
   itself.

<!-- INTRO --> 

<P>
No single programming technique is ideal for every kind of problem.
There are lots of specialized technologies designed for specific
aspects of a Web application, yet trying to combine them creates
problems and bloat. 
It is difficult to deploy a highly interactive Web site that juggles
static HTML, Javascript procedures, Java objects, perl scripts,
plug-ins, and a plethora of ever-changing Microsoft products. This is
quick-sand -- unstable bedrock.  It is hard to make the technologies
work together and interact properly with each other.  It is hard to
control the client set-up for any one of these, much less in
combination.  If the fragile result works, it is huge.  Typically, the
simplest gesture by the user causes a request to the server to
generate another mass of code to be
downloaded.  The client's screen flickers, pauses, and far too often,
crashes.

<P>
Curl&#8482; technology solves these problems -- by allowing
developers to create Web documents
with almost any sort of content, from simple formatted text to complex
interactive applets.  Curl provides a rich set of formatting
operations similar to those of HTML as well as scripting and
robust object-oriented programming capabilities.  Each
capability allows a compact program to be executed on
the client, reducing interaction times and server load.
By unifiying these with a consistent
semantic model, communications obstacles between separately
enapsulated fragments of content can be avoided.

<P>
The value of the
technology is greater than the sum of its parts.  The
total download size and cost of ownership is less than with other
individual technologies, because there is less glue code and
translation, and fewer <I>kinds</I> of code.  This allows a higher
ratio of information content to infrastructure.

<P>The Curl&#8482; technology infrastructure has this foundation:
<UL>

 <P>
 <LI><B>language</B> - By itself, the Curl&#8482; Content Language is
 a modern, multi-paradigm programming language.
 All the capabilities of the libraries and deployment mechanism are
 controlled and integrated through this single language.  
 Within this language,
 developers can choose among declarative, procedural,
 function-oriented, object-oriented, and scripting paradigms based on
 the specific application.  Data
 can be shared between different aspects of an application (e.g., without
 "quoting hell").  Basic abstraction concepts such as procedure and
 class definition can be brought to bear on all.  The <A
 href="language.html">Language Sidebar</A> illustrates some of the
 individual features.

 <P>
 <LI><B>libraries</B> - The language is supplemented with libraries
 for text formatting, graphics and layout operations, and general
 object-oriented programming.  

 <P>
 <LI><B>delivery</B> - This article illustrates the deployment of 
 Curl&#8482; technology as a simple page of content (e.g., a
 <CODE>.curl</CODE> file) sent from an <CODE>HTTP</CODE> server and
 displayed using the Surge&#8482; plug-in.  Curl&#8482; content
 language programs can also be deployed as scripts.

</UL>

<P>
Given this integrated framework, incrementally improving an application's
functionality requires only incremental skill aquisition and
incremental, localized code changes.  For example, you can start with
a page of text to be displayed, add formatting, interaction,
graphics and other computation, and so forth -- without changing
languages or execution environments.  The next four sections
give examples of this progression, illustrating the breadth of the
Curl content language, libraries, and deployment engine.  A fifth
section gives an overview of how the framework supports reliable
deployment and execution.

<P>
The language coherently unifies the multiple paradigms of
object-oriented, functional, procedural, and declarative programming.
It uses both strong, static type declarations and dynamic,
first-class, runtime type information.  Where consistent with Curl's
Web-centric goals, the language is similar to Java and other
C-influenced languages, but it avoids the known weaknesses. (See, for
example, "A Comparison of the Curl Content Language and Java" in the <A
href="http://www.curl.com/docs/appendices.pdf">appendix</A> to the <A
href="http://www.curl.com/html/technology/documentation.jsp">Developer's
Guide</A>.)
<P>
The following example shows what a class definition and type
declarations look like in the language.  The display shows first the
use of a built in layout box mechanism.  It then shows two uses of our
own layout box.  Our layout box has some parameters set by default,
and includes a button to grow the size of the text.  The picture below
shows what this looks like after the user has pressed the middle box's
button several times.

Curl provides an "engine" that processes and executes Curl&#8482;
content language source stored
in files.  The engine can be invoked:
<P>
<UL>
    <LI>By a browser using the Surge&#8482; plug-in.  Each
        <CODE>.curl</CODE> file directly displayed as a page by the plug-in
        is called an applet.  Applets can be embedded in other
        technologies (e.g, HTML) and vice versa.

    <LI>By a special browser with debugging and other program
        development capability, called the Surge Lab&#8482;
        Interactive Development Environment (IDE). 

    <LI>By a shell (e.g., a command line interpreter) to process
        scripts.
    <LI>As an executable produced by Curl Corporation.
        For example, the Surge Lab&#8482; IDE is itself
        written using the Curl&#8482; content language.
</UL>
<P>
The engine is given a file to process. The file is Just-In-Time (JIT)
compiled into native machine code by the engine, and the resulting
machine instructions are executed.
<P>
The plug-in and IDE save the values resulting from the execution of
top-level code, format them, and then display the
result.

<H3><A name="modularity">Modularity</A></H3>
<P>
A group of files can be packaged together and treated as a reusable
unit.  When a file being processed imports a package that is not
already loaded, Curl's engine gets the package on the network.
Packages may be distributed as source or as pre-parsed binaries.
Such binaries are still more compact than machine code, and are still
JIT compiled on the client.
<P>
Packages are versioned.  Different versions are treated as distinct
packages and an application can specify which versions of a package are
to be used.  Different versions of the same package can be used
simultaneously by different parts of the same application.  The entire
engine implementation is similarly versioned.  
<P>
When the engine runs more than one application (e.g., the plug-in
displaying multiple applets in its history), 
each running application is treated as a separate memory area. 
Different applications using the same package work with different
copies of (the heap area of) the package.
<P>
A small persistent object storage mechanism is provided.  This is used:
<UL>
    <LI>for efficiently and safely communicating between different
        applications being run by the same engine, and
    <LI>for long-term communication between different sessions of
        the same or different applications.
</UL>

<H3><A name="security">Security</A></H3>
<P>
By default, Curl's engine prevents applets from doing such
potentially compromising things as interacting with the operating system or
other programs, using too many resources, or displaying graphics that
purport to be something they are not.  Such applets cannot connect to
Web sites other than the ones they came from.  They can use a limited
amount of provided persistent storage.
<P>
End users can elect to specify that applets from certain directories
(on their own or other machines) are to be granted additional
privileges.  The source may be required to be verifiable using SSL.
<P>
Applets, scripts, and applications written in the language cannot corrupt
or misuse their memory or that of any other technology's processes.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<HR> 
<H2><A name="conclusion">Smaller, Faster, Better</A></H2>

<P>
Curl&#8482; technology covers a lot of ground. Procedural graphics
and text can be integrated.  The same language can be used to define
extended formatting operations and a validating GUI suite.  Programs
play well with others by incorporating standard technologies like HTTP
and XML, or by being embedded in HTML, and so forth.  Best practices
are supported in the libraries, deployment mechanims, and the language
itself. 

<P>
By combining this breadth with proper security and web-delivered
module versioning, we can reliably deploy applications that do more
computation on the client with less round-trips between client and
server.  Dynamically fetched application data used by a single,
flexible "page" means less data is needs to be transferred on each
trip. (For example, the client does not need to reload the unchanging
parts of the display.)  Repeated use of custom formats, personalized
GUI, and procedural graphic definitions allows the whole application
mechanism to be more compact.  It all comes together to produce a
dramatically reduced computation and download load on the server --
often an order of magnitude or more.  This gives users a better
experience and site owners a lower operating cost and a stickier site.

<P>
We've seen plenty in Curl&#8482; technology that a variety of developers can
find familiar.  When choosing what to begin using next of all the
different Web technologies, those integrated through the Curl&#8482; content
language should be the most rewarding.
